To update the data files run `./get_data.sh` with the `PACKET_AUTH_TOKEN` env var available.

This repository is [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/experimental-statement.md) meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style! This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.
